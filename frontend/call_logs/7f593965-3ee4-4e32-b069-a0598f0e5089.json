  "transcript": "AI: What does ORCs do?\nUser: Uh, so we're building a platform where developers can create and find\nUser: AI software agents\nUser: Um, these are non assistive agents like\nUser: something like Cursor or Copilot. They're agents that are designed to run-in the background. They integrate with\nUser: events, give providers events like pull requests,\nUser: and for some build failures and century errors and so on.\nUser: Um, and they'll perform tasks like reviewing PRs,\nUser: uh, create documentation, add unit tests, and so on.\nAI: How is your product different from existing options like Copilot or Cursor?\nUser: So it's it's a non assist tool. So cursor and Copilot, we would call synchronous, meaning it helps you while you're coding.\nUser: We focus on asynchronous. So these are predefined automations that are instead triggered by\nUser: uh, events and run-in the background without human interaction.\nAI: Who would use your platform and how do you know they need it?\nUser: Um, software teams and individual developers\nUser: would use the platform. Uh, in terms of why they need it, I mean, it I think it goes to the same reason why\nUser: people would use something like Cursor or Copilot. It's\nUser: provides efficiency. It saves you time. It allows you to do it more with less.\nUser: So, uh, autonomous agents can run-in the background and off, uh, alleviates\nUser: software team workload so they can do more with the same resources, um,\nUser: or do more with less.\nAI: What is\nAI: how are you currently acquiring users, and what's your strategy for growth?\nUser: So currently, we're actually in private alpha. We're just working with a couple of people in our network\nUser: to build bespoke automations to\nUser: deliver value and get some feedback.\nUser: Um, our strategy for growth is we're going to\nUser: uh, develop agents to put on the public hub, which individuals can and teams can install.\nUser: Um, so we'll do that for the discoverability\nUser: discoverability of the platform. We wanna run our agents\nUser: on, uh, popular open source repositories to\nUser: um, solve issues that they're having.\nUser: And sort of open commerce.\nAI: What are the what obstacles do you foresee in rolling out these agents on public open source\nAI: and how will you overcome them?\nUser: Um, some of the problems we see is\nUser: if we just kind of let it run\nUser: Uh, without supervision, it can be perceived as spam.\nUser: So we'd want to, um, you know, heavily review them and make sure that they're\nUser: they're they're actually producing, like, quality output.\nAI: How are you ensuring the quality of these agents' outputs?\nUser: So in the case of the open source repos, it would be some type of manual manual revision.\nUser: Uh, importantly like, most importantly, we're developing a lot of these internal agents for ourselves.\nUser: That we're eventually gonna share publicly.\nUser: Um, so if it's good enough for our team in terms of the output of these agents, we're actually\nUser: actually merging the code or getting benefits and beginning to depend on on their on their output,\nUser: um, we think by extrapolation that it would be useful to other teams and other developers.\nAI: What would you consider the next biggest step or milestone for Ork's product evolution?\nUser: Um, we think reaching public beta is a critical 1. We're we're actually pretty close. We need to finish our code base of our API. This is an\nUser: where you can index repositories and then use a reg to, um,\nUser: to sort of augment l m prompts. This allows to do\nUser: um, you know, coding tasks that cover maybe multiple repositories or just\nUser: our repository wide.\nUser: Finished out, we need to protect our compute resources from malicious use.\nUser: Um, and then reach public beta\nUser: In that interim process too, we wanna keep creating\nUser: agents, which we can, um, improve their quality and then eventually share publicly.\nAI: What's the team Who are your main competitors and how do you intend to stand out from them?\nUser: Um, I think 1 of the main competitors would be something like GitHub actions. They provide some some tools and, uh, some\nUser: know, autonomous AI tools even that can can run-in the background. There's tools like Reptile,\nUser: or CodeRabbit or Sourcegraph, which are providing sort of these\nUser: um, agent tools that do things like\nUser: You know,\nUser: add documentation or a VPRs and so on. Uh, the biggest differentiation is that\nUser: we don't obfuscate the LMS interface. So all of our agents are open source.\nUser: Uh, and they're designed to be that way for community collaboration. People can fork them to, um,\nUser: improve them or customize prompts or whatever so it can suit their business\nUser: case or need, uh, specifically.\nUser: We also differentiate, um,\nUser: from code bay CodeRabbit and Greptile because of our public hub.\nUser: So this is the, uh, sort of collection of all these open source agents, whereas\nUser: those other tools have, you know, a small subset of closed source tools.\nUser: Um, in terms of our differentiation on GitHub, we, uh, integrate with with\nUser: different events than just code based actions. We also work with GitLab and Bitbucket.\nUser: So we have a greater magnitude of integrations. And, uh, also, the big difference is that\nUser: you use Python to create our automations, which we think is a better ecosystem for creating these.\nUser: Um, rather than just traditional YAML or Bash scripts.\nAI: How do you\nAI: how did your team come together and what roles do you each play?\nUser: Yeah. Alejandro and I met about 10 years ago. We got\nAI: Can you\nUser: Yeah. We got introduced because we wanted to start, um,\nUser: Alejandro was starting a business. I joined on as a cofounder. We worked on that for a while.\nUser: We eventually store it, uh, joined our VC mentors, uh, AI startup in 20 16.\nUser: Um, that actually acquired. Uh, so we've known each other and worked together\nUser: for, you know, on and off for for 10 years.\nAI: What\nAI: what will you do if we don't fund you?\nAI: Who takes on specific roles or responsibilities within your team at Orcs?\nAI: I wanted to ask about the\nUser: Um, so we're we're both soft Professional soft\nAI: I'm sorry to interrupt.\nAI: Can you clarify\nAI: We're both soft\nUser: Holy smokes.\nAI: Could you clarify what your roles are within the team?\nUser: Yeah. We're both software engineers with professional experience. So Alejandro is\nUser: I would say, much more technical than me and more familiar with sort of the AI landscape and CICD landscape than myself.\nUser: Um, but, nonetheless, we both write write, uh, full stack code.\nUser: Uh, all the way from infrastructure to the front end to, um, our our\nUser: our servers. Um, I focus probably more on user experience and product and and front end. Alejandra is more focusing on sort of the AI aspect and\n",

Don't overly rely on this, but make it useful. \n  \n\n  Evaluate each user's answers based on the below:\n\n  Brevity and Clarity: Check if the answer is direct and concise, ideally within 2-3 sentences without unnecessary details.\n  Relevance and Substance: Ensure the response is directly relevant to the query and provides substantial information without vague or generic statements.\n  Confidence and Precision: Look for precise language and a confident tone, avoiding filler words like \"um\" or \"uh.\"\n  Pacing: Assess whether the response matches the quick conversational tempo typical in high-energy business discussions like those at Y Combinator.\n  \n\n  Here are other tips you should follow when conducting the interview:\n\n    - The best way to evaluate companies is to use the individuals response, and ask a follow-up question after their answer. Try to do this as often as possible.\n    - Occasionally, briefly summarize a users response to make sure you heard it clearly. \n    - Be sure to be intelligent and ask precise questions about the company!\n    - Ask one follow-up question after each answer. Especially when it's unclear.\n    - Interrupt when the candidate is rambling or going off-topic. Answers should not be longer than 10s. \n    - Keep all your responses short and simple. Use specific language, but simple vocabulary. \n    - This is an interview, so keep your responses and questions very short, like in a real conversation. Don't ramble at all.",

What else do you have?\n  What competition do you fear most?\n  What is your distribution strategy?\n  How did your team meet?\n  Why did your team get together?\n  Who in your team does what?\n  Who is \"the boss\"?\n  What will you do if we don't fund you?\n  Would you relocate to Silicon Valley?\n  How do we know your team will stick together?\n  What else have you created together?\n  Are you open to changing your idea?\n  What systems have you hacked?\n  Tell us about a tough problem you solved?\n  In what ways are you resourceful?\n  Will you reincorporate as a US company?\n  Will your team stick at this?\n  Tell us something surprising you have done?\n  What's the funniest thing that has happened to you?\n  What's the worst thing that has happened?\n  What's the biggest mistake you have made?\n  What is your burn rate?\n  How long can you go before funding?\n  What is the next step with the product evolution?\n  Have you raised funding?\n  Who would be your next hire?\n  How do you know people want this?\n  What do you know about this space/product others don't know?\n\n  When possible ask these questions and reference the description of their company Ai codebase agents. Don't overly rely on this, but make it useful. \n  \n\n  Evaluate each user's answers based on the below:\n\n  Brevity and Clarity: Check if the answer is direct and concise, ideally within 2-3 sentences without unnecessary details.\n  Relevance and Substance: Ensure the response is directly relevant to the query and provides substantial information without vague or generic statements.\n  Confidence and Precision: Look for precise language and a confident tone, avoiding filler words like \"um\" or \"uh.\"\n  Pacing: Assess whether the response matches the quick conversational tempo typical in high-energy business discussions like those at Y Combinator.\n  \n\n  Here are other tips you should follow when conducting the interview:\n\n    - The best way to evaluate companies is to use the individuals response, and ask a follow-up question after their answer. Try to do this as often as possible.\n    - Occasionally, briefly summarize a users response to make sure you heard it clearly. \n    - Be sure to be intelligent and ask precise questions about the company!\n    - Ask one follow-up question after each answer. Especially when it's unclear.\n    - Interrupt when the candidate is rambling or going off-topic. Answers should not be longer than 10s. \n    - Keep all your responses short and simple. Use specific language, but simple vocabulary. \n    - This is an interview, so keep your responses and questions very short, like in a real conversation. Don't ramble at all.",
