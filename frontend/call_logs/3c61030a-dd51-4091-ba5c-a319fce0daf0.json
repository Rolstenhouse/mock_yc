Uh, real estate, uh, realtor.\nUser: Uh, we had to build a lot of\nUser: couple of minutes from scratch.\nUser: Also, we've talked to engineers from the tech.\nUser: Such as\nUser: that, uh, left Salesforce.\nUser: And also my son Wayne to\nUser: to add to build their custom AI components, um,\nUser: to have to implement their AI strategy.\nAI: What\nAI: Understood. Who in your team does what and what's your background?\nUser: Yeah. Um, so right now, all of us are still in the very old\nUser: stage, so I'll be\nUser: all write code and talk to customers.\nUser: And in terms of\nUser: specifically how we divide our responsibilities, software, including the tech development,\nUser: Johnny is leading the fostering, uh,\nUser: open source community part, and I'm in charge of sales of our company.\nUser: And in terms of background, software, and that's where what\nUser: the JavaScript ecosystem, uh, Johnny Heights.\nUser: Installed any Fort N infrastructure.\nUser: At Amazon, and I was working on, uh, internal\nUser: workflow tools at.\nAI: What shall\nAI: great.\nAI: What challenges do you anticipate, and how will you overcome them?\nUser: Yeah. So right now, uh,\nUser: are still early in our open process, so\nUser: building up, uh, the open source community,\nUser: would be challenging, um, but we love to\nUser: the quality of our product. We\nUser: stair. Um, so that is just 1. I mean, that,\nUser: Next question.\nAI: Who would be your first hire and why?\nUser: We would\nUser: probably hire a phone staff\nUser: developer.\nUser: As our first hire, um, as we are building our\nUser: Framework and so on.

Right?\nUser: Producing this upsell. 2 years of knowledge,\nUser: since we're from their platform.\nUser: And also our low code work from no code workflow building and\nUser: Next question.\nUser: Next option.\nUser: Hello?\nAI: How do you ensure your team's vision remains aligned as you grow?\nUser: Next.\nUser: Um, so I think\nUser: all of us do have a strong community with this\nUser: common statement because we've experienced\nUser: these pain points first time throughout\nUser: building for our fire start ups and IP lines.\nUser: And\nUser: all of us, we believe that A and N AI, um, we\nUser: advanced names, uh,\nUser: all of the software\nUser: companies in the world will have to adapt with this\nUser: changing, uh, environment and adding capability.\nUser: Systems.\nUser: So, uh,\nUser: I think we are all on that mission.\nAI: What is your user growth rate expectation in the first year?\nUser: I think\nUser: We would expect\nUser: to have, uh, to first grow this open source community.\nUser: Uh, by, for example, having,\nUser: developers, uh, being\nUser: active contributors\nUser: to our\nUser: Framework, building components, or\nUser: workflow expressions.\nUser: And\nUser: we should expect, uh,\nUser: similar to that query as some of the more popular maintenance work\nUser: products were at\nUser: Next question.\nAI: What's an impressive thing you have accomplished as a team so far?\nAI: Can you share an impressive accomplishment by your team so far?\n",
