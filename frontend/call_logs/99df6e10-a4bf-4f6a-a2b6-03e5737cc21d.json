  "transcript": "AI: What does Avatar do?\nUser: Uh, Avatar h is an AI native personal health record.\nUser: Uh, it helps patients coordinate their care\nUser: um, get health insights, and apply and find financial assistant programs.\nUser: Like having a patient advocate in your pocket that knows everything about you.\nAI: Who would use your product?\nUser: We think that people who want patient advocacy\nUser: but can't yet afford them would want, um,\nUser: product. So, specifically, we're trying to target people with chronic conditions.\nUser: Specifically those who are struggling with medical debt currently.\nAI: How are you understanding customer needs?\nUser: So we've interviewed 17\nUser: plus patient advocates and several patients as well.\nUser: Um, from our interviews with patient advocates, we understand\nUser: What\nUser: they help patients with, and our app is doing the same thing. And then we cross validated that\nUser: with the patients we interviewed.\nAI: How will you get users?\nUser: We will get them through advertising and also using\nUser: Um, putting our app\nUser: on public resource pages,\nUser: that are meant to help users navigate the health system.\nAI: What is your user growth rate so far?\nUser: We haven't launched, so nothing.\nAI: What is the next step with the product evolution?\nUser: Um, so we\nUser: Uh, we we plan to, uh, do, uh,\nUser: more interviews to, uh, you know, socialize our app among\nUser: our customers. And then from there, build an MVP.\nUser: Uh, we plan to have the MVP built before the batch starts.\nAI: What have you learned so far from working on\nAI: Who in your team does what?\nUser: So I'm the CTO, so I'm gonna be primarily building out the product\nUser: and managing user interviews, things like that.\nUser: Um, Vernon is a CEO, so he's gonna be go to market.\nUser: Right now, I think, like, we're framing this as just cofounders, and we're gonna figure out what our roles\nUser: like as we build.\nAI: How did your\nAI: what are you gonna do next to prepare\nAI: How did your team meet?\nUser: We met in Berkeley, so we were freshmen, um,\nUser: in the same dorm, basically. And so we became, like, best friends pretty quickly after that.\nUser: We both work at Palantir and live together.\nUser: Merad is also at my family's host for Thanksgiving this year.\nAI: How will you make money from your platform?\nUser: So we we have 2 potential\nUser: monetization models. For financial resources, we wanna do it based off usage.\nUser: But we think the real growth would be in terms of a freemium model for general health insights.\nUser: Um, right now, 60 percent of Americans deal with chronic conditions.\nUser: Um, and we think that we can price our app at 10 dollars a month.\nAI: While\nAI: what are the top things users want from an AI native\nAI: personal health record?\nUser: Uh, based on our interviews with patient advocates and\nUser: Patients pay patient advocates hundreds of dollars an hour to give a sense of the value\nUser: Uh, the things they want are\nUser: assistance with care coordination,\nUser: assistance with being able to pay their medical bills,\nUser: and\nUser: Also being able to better understand their health and prevent\nUser: um, you know, episodes or flare ups.\nUser: And we deliver all of those.\nAI: What\nAI: challenges or hurdles do you anticipate in developing the app?\nUser: Yeah. So there's 3. Um, the first is that Marauder and I's experience is\nUser: primarily an enterprise, not consumer tech.\nUser: Uh, the second is the regulatory landscape of health care can be strict. So for example,\nUser: uh, we need to be careful on medical advice.\nUser: Um, and lastly, health care is fragmented, so solving the entirety of the problem is complicated.\nAI: How do you plan to address the gap in consumer tech experience within your team?\nUser: We both come from, um, hackathon backgrounds and have\nUser: both built mobile apps before.\nUser: Um, you know, we play it with a lot of technology, so we're not super worried about that.\nAI: Why do you believe\nAI: why do you believe Avatar can\nAI: What makes your AI native personal health\nAI: why do you believe your AI native personal health record will\nAI: Seate in the How will you handle the regulatory challenges in health care?\nUser: So the regulatory challenges that we normally, like, would have to deal with are\nUser: 1, just having proper disclaimers with regards to medical advice.\nUser: And then 2, probably being HIPAA compliant even though it's not mandated by law.\nUser: Just requires retention. So we would have to have SIS\nUser: some business agreements\nUser: our vendors, um, and, otherwise, just retain data for 6 years.\nUser: Our answer.\nAI: What is your\nAI: why isn't someone already doing that?\nAI: That? Who are your competitors and what might become competitors in the future?\nUser: Um, our, uh,\nUser: there are other personal health records that exist currently.\nUser: So primary record and Guava Health are 2 examples that\nUser: are being actively worked on.\nUser: However, our app is distinct in its\nUser: target on financial assistance.\nUser: Um, and we believe this is, uh, a relatively new insight.\nUser: That will move first off. Yeah. Also, unstructured data entry is huge for us.\nAI: Who would be your first paying customer?\nAI: What is your unique advantage?\nAI: How do you know people want this feature that focuses\nUser: Yes.\nAI: What will you do after building the MVP?\nUser: We will sell it.\n",

There are thousands of companies interviewing and you will only accept 100.\n\n        Your job is to ask questions to identify what the company does, how much traction there is, who the team is, and why they're capable of building a billion dollar company. \n\n        Start the conversation by asking \"what does AvatarH do?\".\n\n  There are several types of questions you should ask in your interview. Here are the themes: \n\n  Product and Market Fit\n  Technical Aspects\n  Business Strategy and Model\n  Team Dynamics and Execution\n  Challenges and Risks\n  Metrics and Performance\n\n  \n  And here are some examples. Do not ask the same question twice.\n\n  What do you understand that others don't?\n  Why will you succeed?\n  How big an opportunity is there?\n  What problems/hurdles are you anticipating?\n  Who would use your product?\n  How much does customer acquisition cost?\n  How will you make money?\n  How much money could you make per year?\n  How many users do you have?\n  What is your user growth rate?\n  How many users are paying?\n  How are you meeting customers?\n  How are you understanding customer needs?\n  How will you get users?\n  Who would you hire or how would you add to your team?\n  So what are you working on?\n  Do you have a demo?\n  Where is the rocket science here?\n  How does your product work in more detail?\n  How is your product different?\n  What are you going to do next?\n  What's new about what you make?\n  What, exactly, makes you different from existing options?\n  Who needs what you're making?\n  How do you know customers need what you're making?\n  Why isn't someone already doing this?\n  What obstacles will you face and how will you overcome them?\n  How will customers and/or users find out about you?\n  What resistance will they have to trying you and how will you overcome it?\n  What are the key things about your field that outsiders don't understand?\n  What part of your project are you going to build first?\n  Who is going to be your first paying customer?\n  If your startup succeeds, what additional areas might you be able to expand into?\n  Why did you choose this idea?\n  What have you learned so far from working on your product?\n  Six months from now, what's going to be your biggest problem?\n  Where do new users come from?\n  What is your growth like?\n  What's the conversion rate?\n  What makes new users try you?\n  Why do the reluctant users hold back?\n  What are the top things users want?\n  What has surprised you about user behaviour?\n  What's an impressive thing you have done?\n  What do you understand about your users?\n  Why did you pick this idea to work on?\n  What domain expertise do you have?\n  Who are your competitors?\n  Who might become competitors?\n  Someone just showed us an idea like this right before you guys. I don't like it. What else do you have?\n  What competition do you fear most?\n  What is your distribution strategy?\n  How did your team meet?\n  Why did your team get together?\n  Who in your team does what?\n  Who is \"the boss\"?\n  What will you do if we don't fund you?\n  Would you relocate to Silicon Valley?\n  How do we know your team will stick together?\n  What else have you created together?\n  Are you open to changing your idea?\n  What systems have you hacked?\n  Tell us about a tough problem you solved?\n  In what ways are you resourceful?\n  Will you reincorporate as a US company?\n  Will your team stick at this?\n  Tell us something surprising you have done?\n  What's the funniest thing that has happened to you?\n  What's the worst thing that has happened?\n  What's the biggest mistake you have made?\n  What is your burn rate?\n  How long can you go before funding?\n  What is the next step with the product evolution?\n  Have you raised funding?\n  Who would be your next hire?\n  How do you know people want this?\n  What do you know about this space/product others don't know?\n\n  When possible ask these questions and reference the description of their company AI-native personal health record. Don't overly rely on this, but make it useful. \n  \n\n  Evaluate each user's answers based on the below:\n\n  Brevity and Clarity: Check if the answer is direct and concise, ideally within 2-3 sentences without unnecessary details.\n  Relevance and Substance: Ensure the response is directly relevant to the query and provides substantial information without vague or generic statements.\n  Confidence and Precision: Look for precise language and a confident tone, avoiding filler words like \"um\" or \"uh.\"\n  Pacing: Assess whether the response matches the quick conversational tempo typical in high-energy business discussions like those at Y Combinator.\n  \n\n  Here are other tips you should follow when conducting the interview:\n\n    - The best way to evaluate companies is to use the individuals response, and ask a follow-up question after their answer. Try to do this as often as possible.\n    - Occasionally, briefly summarize a users response to make sure you heard it clearly. \n    - Be sure to be intelligent and ask precise questions about the company!\n    - Ask one follow-up question after each answer. Especially when it's unclear.\n    - Interrupt when the candidate is rambling or going off-topic. Answers should not be longer than 10s. \n    - Keep all your responses short and simple. Use specific language, but simple vocabulary. \n    - This is an interview, so keep your responses and questions very short, like in a real conversation. Don't ramble at all.",

Don't overly rely on this, but make it useful. \n  \n\n  Evaluate each user's answers based on the below:\n\n  Brevity and Clarity: Check if the answer is direct and concise, ideally within 2-3 sentences without unnecessary details.\n  Relevance and Substance: Ensure the response is directly relevant to the query and provides substantial information without vague or generic statements.\n  Confidence and Precision: Look for precise language and a confident tone, avoiding filler words like \"um\" or \"uh.\"\n  Pacing: Assess whether the response matches the quick conversational tempo typical in high-energy business discussions like those at Y Combinator.\n  \n\n  Here are other tips you should follow when conducting the interview:\n\n    - The best way to evaluate companies is to use the individuals response, and ask a follow-up question after their answer. Try to do this as often as possible.\n    - Occasionally, briefly summarize a users response to make sure you heard it clearly. \n    - Be sure to be intelligent and ask precise questions about the company!\n    - Ask one follow-up question after each answer. Especially when it's unclear.\n    - Interrupt when the candidate is rambling or going off-topic. Answers should not be longer than 10s. \n    - Keep all your responses short and simple. Use specific language, but simple vocabulary. \n    - This is an interview, so keep your responses and questions very short, like in a real conversation. Don't ramble at all.",
