  "summary": "The conversation is quite unclear due to the fragmented and incomplete responses. It seems like AI asked about Tali's function, to which the user described it as a no code form builder intended to assist developers with building something related to \"Paul\" and potentially using numbers 2 and 3. However, the context and specific details are unclear and difficult to interpret based on the given transcript.",
