  "transcript": "AI: What does NASH do?\nUser: Nash builds deep learning models that detect signs of different psychiatric and neurological disorders using data collected from variables. Do you have any other questions?\nAI: How do you know how do you know customers need what you're making?\nUser: Um, we've been speaking with doctors who have told us about how they have to deal with information reported by patients, which is generally extremely unreliable. You can also see things like misdiagnosis rates, which are extremely prevalent. And that's why we think that what we're making provides this objective standpoint for doctors here.\nAI: What's your what's your strategy for convincing doctors to adopt this technology?\nUser: Um, first thing is, um, we're gonna do pre clinical studies. We're gonna do clinical studies. Uh, we wanna involve them in the process from the beginning. So show them, uh, there's a learning curve for doctors as well. We wanna get an FDA approval, um, And uh, again, so going down the regulatory part for that. Um, and basically just involving them in the process and making sure they're actually able to use it as the data point when they make a diagnosis.\nAI: Who would be How do you plan to fund these preclinical and clinical studies necessary for de approval.\nUser: Um, we think the funding from YC would help with that. Um, for lots of preclinical studies, we'll do it on large cross validation datasets, uh, which we can obtain for free. Using the Olyphant research program, which is how we've gotten all of our data right now. Um, and we assume that, uh, we think a lot of the the the funding will go towards clinical studies, um, and model training.\n",

  "summary": "The conversation revolves around the company NASH, which builds deep-learning models to detect psychiatric and neurological disorders using data collected from various sources. The user discusses their approach to understanding customer needs by consulting with doctors, addressing the issue of unreliable patient-reported information, and the high rates of misdiagnosis. They also outline their strategy for convincing doctors to adopt the technology, including conducting preclinical and clinical studies in collaboration with physicians. Funding for these studies is expected to come from Y Combinator and utilizing large cross-validation datasets from the Olyphant research program.",
