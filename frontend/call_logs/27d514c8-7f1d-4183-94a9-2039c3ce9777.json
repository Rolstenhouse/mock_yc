  "transcript": "AI: What does Autodocs do?\nUser: Autodox is a tool automatically updates a company's documentation every time there's a product release. We're focused on documentation now, but in the future, we wanna go into all kinds of assets um, you know, videos, sales decks, you know, 1 central place auto updates with every single product release so that product teams can focus on what they do best. Next question.\nAI: That sounds Was your How do you plan on monetizing auto docs?\nUser: Um, well, it's gonna be a b 2 b SaaS sort of model. We're gonna charge per seat. It's yeah, it is hard to say now. It kinda depends what what where we go into, whether we're a kind of platform that all employees uh, or that many different employees can can you know, read updates from and and contribute to the documentation, in which case we'd probably charge per seat. If it's more something that's only used by a few people in the organization, then we'd probably look Uh, you know, how much time does this save each tech writer? What's the average salary for tech writer? You know, maybe 70, 80? Grand. And if that's saving some time, we charge some proportion of that. Think on average, it would be you know, 15 to 20000 contract per organization.\nAI: It seems how do you validate that people are willing to pay for your service at price point you're targeting what's auto dot How do you assess customer needs and ensure that your product is aligned with them?\nUser: So Um, so we've we've spoken to many different tech writers. At the moment, and they've all what's been really nice for us to see is that, you know, they've all sort of mentioned that this problem that they have a lot of content that needs updating. They have a lot of different places that it needs updating. Um, and they all kind of came to the same solution themselves, something that listens to these product changes and automatically flags You know, automatically flags the sections that are needed. Um, how do we make sure that our product is aligned with them? Well, you know, it's it's it's early stages. What we're trying to do is find our first customer. We're sending out demos at the moment. We're running pipeline. And yeah, we we started doing this yesterday, so hopefully, we we get good feedback. And, you know, we've already started tweaking things. Some people were not clear what was what was it was showing, and Um, you know, yeah. Next question. I think it's gonna be like this though. Like, this is just going like 1 random arbitrary question. After the other, whereas it feels like it should be more of a conversation. Yeah. Who made this? This sucks.\nAI: You've mentioned understood you've been reaching out to potential customers for initial feedback. In terms of market size, big of an opportunity is there for Autodocs?\nUser: Yeah. We think big. I mean, we think this this this is a problem that affects many tech companies, many many companies that that ship fast and have a need for documentation. Um, if we assume that that it's gonna be a problem that's faced by companies with product managers, then there's about 70000 to a hundred thousand of them globally. And we can assume that they will have the need to update some materials with every product release be that internal materials or, you know, videos or or whatever. And eventually, we wanna we wanna target this. We wanna completely offload that burden make sure that companies, you know, don't need these large teams to maintain these assets. And just have it all kind of living in the same way, you know, CICD automation does every time a a product is released. Next question. I thought you want do you do you wanna take some of the products once though? We can. Because if it's like you know, how how do you know there's a need for the product? Is that a market I guess, kind of market question? Most things are gonna be market. There might also be founder question, like, why why us? Yeah. If they ask, like, why you too? I I I'll I'll I don't know. You wanna take it? You you wanna jump in, or do you wanna stop? We'll see see how you feel. I'll start. Okay. Yeah. I mean, I feel like we know the answer to that 1. It's like, yeah. Beliefs and what we've learned. Okay. I I think anything market Like, Cost You know, like, 10 stuff like that you can take. Okay. Anything products, like technical, I'll take. Anything in between, we'll just install it. If it's all in between, yeah, it might be a bit messy, but good. Can I mean, if if if, like, that's I will assume you probably take the lead the most? But if you feel like you've been talking like, it would be either of us feel like you've been talking for a bit too long, in terms of Yeah. If I feel like required for that type of thing. Maybe you should then I'll I'll try speak. And then if I fuck up, you can just help me. Yeah. On vice versa. Yeah.\n",
