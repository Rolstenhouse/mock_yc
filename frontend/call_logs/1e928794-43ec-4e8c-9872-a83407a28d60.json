  "transcript": "AI: What does Altero do?\nUser: Yeah. Altira does real time zoning reports for real estates.\nAI: Who would you how do you know customers need what you're making?\nUser: We know because we've talked to Zonomics who already does it manually. And has partnerships with Redfin and all. But they still go through the 90000 jurisdictions manually. There's no because we talked to city builder, who would pay if we can provide it in real time because they know how laborious it is, and they are not AI users. Yeah.\nAI: What is your How do you plan to overcome the challenge of gathering and updating zoning information from all these jurisdictions in real time?\nUser: We, uh, gonna manually have to plug into all these CT consoles, which is our mode. And then build out the streaming into Whisper. Which is a transcription service. And then we have to do our AI 11 act insight reporting. Which we have done for Connecticut. So we have proven that we can do it with high accuracy and also their manual.\n",

  "summary": "The conversation is about Altero, a company that provides real-time zoning reports for real estate. The user mentions that they know customers need their product because they have spoken to Zonomics, a company doing similar work manually, and city builders who find the manual process laborious. The user explains their plan to overcome the challenge of gathering and updating zoning information by manually plugging into jurisdiction consoles, using a transcription service called Whisper, and applying their AI for insight reporting. They mention having already proven their ability to do this accurately for Connecticut.",
